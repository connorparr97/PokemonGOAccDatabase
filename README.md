# WPF App for my Pokemon GO Accounts communicating with my local SQL server
Small WPF application interacting with a local SQL server to help maintain and keep my account sales organised.

Currently this applications functionality is primarly coded in the Mainpage.XAML.cs code behind file. I plan to potentially re-do the UI to look a lot nicer
& I plan to to move the functionality from the code behind file to a MVC architecture
